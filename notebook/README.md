All notebooks were run using the NVIDIA A100 GPU on Google Colab, which was necessary due to the size of the dataset.

You have to add the file 'embbedings_with_molecule_names.csv' and 'GSE70138_Broad_LINCS_gene_info_2017-03-06.txt' to your Drive otherwise you will not be able tu run the notebook named 'dataset.ipynb'.


Additionally, the aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key for the S3 bucket must be stored in Colab Secrets.

Finally, you have to run the notebooks in this order : 

 1) from_S3_to_Drive(1).ipynb
 2) dataset(1).ipynb
 3) EDA(3).ipynb
 4) prediction(2).ipynb


If you want to work only with the final cleaned and merged dataset that we used for the EDA and for the prediction, here is the link from our personal Drive.
