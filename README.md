Dear reader,

Here you will be able to access our work for the data,data storage and data collection. 
1) In the weights folder you will be able to access the final trained model that we implemented.
2) In the notebook folder you will be able to access all the pre-processing, the EDA and predictive task notebooks as well as a way to access the final and clean dataset.


Best regards,
Millan Das, Arthur de Leusse & Alexis Vannson
