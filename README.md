Dear reader,

Here you will be able to access our work for the data,data storage and data collection project where we explore if we can successfully integrate molecular structure data using Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES)representations with genome-wide gene expression signatures to create a unified dataset that captures drug-induced cellular perturbations. Specifically, we aim to evaluate whether the LINCS L1000 dataset, combined with molecular embeddings, provides a robust foundation for future predictive modeling of drug responses. 

1) In the script folder you can find the collection part and upload to s3 bucket
2) In the notebook folder you will be able to access all the pre-processing, the EDA and predictive task notebooks as well as a way to access the final and clean dataset.
4) In the weights folder you will be able to access the final trained model that we implemented.
5) In the mol-insight folder is a web App that displays the result we are aiming at


Best regards,
Millan Das, Arthur de Leusse & Alexis Vannson
